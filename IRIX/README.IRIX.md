# Troubleshooting

- SGI O2 CRM graphics: 
Default graphics detail settings might be too high for this setup.
Check ~/.homeworld/Homeworld.cfg and adjust window resolution to a lower one, also disable fullscreen. Once you're able to start the app to get to the home screen, go to options and set graphics details to a lower level.
