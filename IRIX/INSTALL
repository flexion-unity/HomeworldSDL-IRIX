 -System requirements for IRIX-

 SDL 2 from SGUG-RSE with GL support (!!)
 GCC (SGUG-RSE)
 
 -Compiling the source code-

You need to have at least the following packages installed:

 * SDL2 development files
 * flex (any recent version will do)
 * bison (any recent version will do)
 * autotools set: autoconf, automake (1.9), libtool
 * YACC (any recent version will do)

The build process itself is relatively straightforward. Running the bootstrap script found in this directory with "./bootstrap" will set up the files needed and then doing "../configure" (that's "period period slash configure") followed by "make" will build the required files and then the binary. Type "../configure --help" for more information on build options.

 ./bootstrap
 ./configure_irix.sh
 make

If "make" is successful then the "homeworld' binary will be located in the "src" directory created just now within the "IRIX" directory. 

 -Usage and placement of the game data files-

 Once you have successfully compiled the source you will still need the Homeworld CD and the Homeworld 1.05 version patch for some data files before you can play. The game requires these files. They have not been provided with the source code or with the SDL port as they are not freely available, You can find the patch at http://www.relicnews.com, and you can also find the patch, and other downloads as well at http://homesource.nekomimicon.net 
 
 You will need at least 
 - Homeworld.big 
 - Update.big 

Homeworld.big comes from the game CD, and the Update.big file has to be the updated version from the 1.05 patch.

Unfortunately the only way to extract Homeworld.big and accompanying data files from the Windows installer is to run it natively in Windows or use an emulator/compatibility layer like Wine. (Alternatively, if someone cares to work on it, a native installer could be created based on the public domain "HWUN" (Heuristic WISE Unpacker) program. This is known to work with HWSetup.exe but unfortunately uses VirtualPascal and its accompanying Windows libraries. There are similar programs to HWUN (e.g. e_wise (Pascal) and exwise (C)) but they don't work with HWSetup.exe as-is.)

The files from the patch are simpler to get at: just open the patch .exe in any zip file program and extract the Update.big files from it.
 
 You can place the game data files in the 'src' directory created within the Linux directory where the "homeworld' binary you just compiled is located. 
 
 Even though the main data files are present now, you will still need to have the Homeworld CD in your CD-ROM drive AND mounted. The game will check that the CD is mounted on "/mnt/cdrom", but if you use a different mount point, you will need to specify it using the "HW_CDROM" environment variable. 
 
 To avoid this you can copy the audio data files 'HW_Comp.vce' and 'HW_Music.wxd' from the Homeworld CD to the 'src' directory alongside the other data files. These archives hold the voice + subtitle files and the music data files respectively... and then you can get along without the CD in the drive. However, the audio data files will take up 155 MB of space.

 -Starting the game-

Go to the projects 'src' directory. "./homeworld". 

 For those who installed the game, instead of running it from the project directory, efforts have been made to set everything up such that "make install" will work, but you will still need to do a few things before running. Specifically, if you installed the game using 'make install' the binary will be able to find the game data in one of two ways: 
 
    -The environment variable "HW_Data" (case-sensitive, without quotes) can be set to the path where the game data is located. For example, if you put the data in /usr/local/share/homeworld, you could run the game by typing the following from the command line: 
 
    HW_Data=/usr/local/share/homeworld homeworld 
 
    - If the "HW_Data" environment variable is not set, or the path specified by it cannot be found, the game will check the current directory.  For example, if you put the game data in a directory called "hw", you would only need to change to that directory and run "homeworld" without specifying anything for "HW_Data", and the executable should be able to find the data without any problem. 
 
 NOW you should be able to start the game...but wait!  There's one last thing you need to know! 
 
 When Homeworld first starts up, it uses the software renderer. Unfortunately, the porting of the software renderer is not yet complete (filled 3D textures do not seem to render currently), so you will need to switch to the OpenGL renderer.  To do so, perform the following steps: 
 
    - Select "Options" from the main game menu. 
    - Select "Video" from the available options sub-menus listed on
      the right side of the screen. 
    - Select "(GL) Default OpenGL" from the "Rendering System" box. 
    - Choose a resolution from the "Resolution" box (any resolution
      you choose will do fine). 
    - Click on the "Accept!" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. 
 
 The game will now attempt to switch to the OpenGL renderer.  
 If everything goes okay, you should be presented with a confirmation that the settings you requested were changed.  Select "Yes", and you should be ready to go!
 
 The settings you choose will also be saved when you quit, so you don't have to reselect the OpenGL renderer every time.
